    "In this notebook, we will be using the latest AMBER force fields. The OpenMM documentation contains [a complete overview of included force fields](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/application.html#force-fields). The corresponding data files can be viewed on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openmm/openmm/tree/master/wrappers/python/openmm/app/data). These files are already included in every OpenMM installation, so you don't need to download them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to avoid getting lost in the force field zoo, here are the key references to various AMBER force fields and some comments on the history of their development:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1997 `amber96.xml`: a slight improvement of AMBER ff94 with ab initio calculations, not very significant. [REF](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-1120-3_2)\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2006 `amber99sb.xml`: a refinement of amber ff94 side-chain and mostly backbone (SB) torsional parameters, to obtain better balance between stabilities of different secondary structure elements, in the literature referred to as AMBER ff99SB. [REF](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fprot.21123)\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2003 `amber03.xml`: improvement of AMBER ff99SB by refitting of torsional parameters to ab initio data, referred to as AMBER ff03. [REF](https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.10349)\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2010 `amber99sbildn.xml`: refitting of AMBER ff99sb to improve side-chain conformations to match NMR data, in the literature referred to as AMBER ff99SB-ILDN. [REF](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fprot.22711)\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2010 `amber99sbnmr.xml`: another (not as popular) refitting of AMBER ff99SB parameters to NMR data. [REF](https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.201001898)\n",
    "\n",
    "- ???? `amber10.xml`: origin not clear (yet), it is certainly an intermediate step in the development of AMBER ff14SB.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2015 `amber14-all.xml` or `amber14/protein.xml`: improved side-chain and backbone parameters starting from AMBER ff99SB, in the literature referred to as AMBER ff14SB. [REF](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00255)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the more recent and widely used AMBER force field is **AMBER ff14SB**. If for some reason, you need to use an older model, **AMBER ff99SB-ILDN** or **AMBER ff99SB** could be useful. The remaining ones are rarely used anymore. Also a few newer developments exist but will not be used in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another popular family of biomolecular force fields are the CHARMM force fields. The [CHARMM36](https://doi.org/10.1021/ct300400x) force field was published in 2012 and its development followed similar steps as that of AMBER. In 1992 the CHARMM22 force field was released. In 2004, so-called [CMAP corrections](https://doi.org/10.1021/ja036959e) were released based on *ab initio* reference data, to improve the accuracy of the backbone conformations. In CHARMM36 this was taken one (big) step further, with more accurate *ab initio* data and follow-up refinements against NMR data.\n",
    "The files `charmm36.xml` and `charmm36/*.xml` were only included recently in OpenMM and these will not be used for this year's edition of the tutorial.\n",

There was barely any equilibration in the previous two runs, mainly because the few degrees of freedom were all relatively fast motions. More complex structures tend to exhibit also slower motions. For example, in our current run with explicit water molecules, the solvent needs more time to equilibrate."

    "The Ramachandran plot is strongly influenced by the choice of solvent model. Already for a simple dipeptide, the limitations of an implicit solvent model are clear. The reason is that the amide groups participate in the hydrogen-bonding network of the solvent. These are rather specific and directional interactions, which are absent in implicit solvent models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference with the first two runs is the slower change of the back-bone angles. There are fewer changes between conformations and switching also takes longer. This is due to the friction with and the inertia of the surrounding water molecules. Hence, a single time step with explicit solvent is more costly and one has to perform longer simulations because water slows down conformational changes. For this reason, implicit solvent models are still popular, despite the fact that they are very approximate. Note that the explicit-solvent simulations in this notebook are not long enough to obtain converged statistics."
