    "1. If you have not used the HPC yet for other parts of the tutorial, copy the following files to a directory on the HPC:\n",
    "   - `01_run_openmm_on_a_hpc.ipynb`\n",
    "   - `alanine-dipeptide.pdb`\n",
    "   - `job_openmm.sh`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When you use the job script `job_openmm.sh` for another notebook, you should edit `job_openmm.sh` to change `01_run_openmm_on_a_hpc.ipynb` to the name of your notebook.\n",
    "   You can also change the `SBATCH` arguments to suit your needs:\n",
    "  \n",
    "   - Number of CPU cores is set by `--cpus-per-task`.\n",
    "   - Maximum wall time is set by `--time`. (Your job will be killed in case your calculation does not stop in time.)\n",
    "  \n",
    "   The `sbatch` program supports many other options to control the execution of the job.\n",
    "  Consult the [`sbatch` documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After creating the job script, run `sbatch job_openmm.sh`.\n",
    "  This will put your job on the queue, and as soon as resources are available to run your job, it will be executed.\n",
    "  To debug job scripts, it is recommended to test them on the Slaking cluster first.\n",
    "  Once it is working as expected, you can switch to more performing clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can check the status of your job with the `squeue` command, or on [login.hpc.ugent.be](https://login.hpc.ugent.be).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Once the job has completed, a copy of this notebook is created with all the outputs (`01_run_openmm_on_a_hpc.nbconvert.ipynb`), and also all other output files can be found in the same directory."
