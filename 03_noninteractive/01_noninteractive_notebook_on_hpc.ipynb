    "# Run demanding OpenMM notebooks non-interactively on an HPC\n",
    "\n",
    "**<span style=\"color:#A03;font-size:14pt\">\n",
    "&#x270B; HANDS-ON! &#x1F528;\n",
    "</span>**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you have not used the HPC yet for other parts of the tutorial, copy the following files to a directory on the HPC:\n",
    "   - `01_noninteractive_notebook_on_hpc.ipynb`\n",
    "   - `alanine-dipeptide.pdb`\n",
    "   - `job_openmm_hpc_cpu.sh` (job script for generic HPC setup, may need tweaking)\n",
    "   - `job_openmm_vsc_cpu.sh` (works on VSC clusters)\n",
    "   - `job_openmm_vsc_gpu.sh` (works on VSC clusters with GPUs)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When you use a job script (`job_...`) for another notebook, you should edit it and change `01_noninteractive_notebook_on_hpc.ipynb` to the name of your notebook.\n",
    "   You can also change the `SBATCH` arguments to suit your needs:\n",
    "  \n",
    "   - Number of CPU cores is set by `--cpus-per-task`.\n",
    "   - Number of GPU cores is set by `--gpus-per-task`. (Not more than 1)\n",
    "   - Maximum wall time is set by `--time`. (Your job will be killed in case your calculation does not stop in time.)\n",
    "   - Maximum memory usage is set by `--mem`. (Your job will be killed when it uses more. If you don't specify this, the default is very low.)\n",
    "  \n",
    "   The `sbatch` program supports many other options to control the execution of the job.\n",
    "   Consult the [`sbatch` documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After creating the job script, run `sbatch job_openmm_cpu.sh`, or `sbatch job_openmm_gpu.sh` if the cluster has GPU nodes.\n",
    "   This will put your job on the queue, and as soon as resources are available to run your job, it will be executed.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   For **VSC** users:\n",
    "   To debug a job script, it is recommended to test on the Slaking cluster first.\n",
    "   Once it is working as expected, you can switch to a production cluster.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The default cluster is `victini` when submitting jobs.\n",
    "   If you want to use another cluster, you need to run the following command, before calling `sbatch`:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   module swap cluster/slaking\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "   To see the available clusters:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   module av cluster/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can check the status of your job with the `squeue` command\n",
    "   VSC users can also check their job queue on [login.hpc.ugent.be](https://login.hpc.ugent.be).\n",
    "   Note that in a virtual terminal, you only get to see your jobs running on the current cluster.\n",
    "   Also for this, you need switch to the right cluster, e.g. with `module swap cluster/...`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Once the job has completed, a copy of this notebook is created with all the outputs \n",
    "   (`01_run_openmm_on_a_hpc.nbconvert.ipynb`), and also all other output files can be found in the same directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes for the GPU job script:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The GPU jobscript sets a variable `OPENMM_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=CUDA`, which tells OpenMM to use GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For VSC users:\n",
    "  - It only makes sense to submit `job_openmm_gpu.sh` on `joltik` or `accelgor` Tier-2 clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - On `joltik`, it is recommended to use 8 CPUs per GPU.\n",
    "    On `accelgor`, this becomes 12 CPUs per GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The GPU speedup for this notebook (on Joltik) is about a factor 30."
